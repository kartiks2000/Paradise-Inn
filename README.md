# Paradise-Inn
designed and developed by KARTIK SAXENA


Hello folks...

This is awebsite designed and developed by me. As we know todays computing world is more dominant by the handheld devices rather then thr traditional PC's hence i have made it with the Mobile-first approach. for best experience kindly render it on a mobile device or tablets like iPad.

This website have been made responsive throughout all the devices and hopefully you wont encounter any issues but P.S its best to use it in portrait mode for a betetr experience.

The color scheme might seem a bit vague and unplanned because havent really worked on a color scheme yet, they are just dummy colors to give you a feel of the websites

Technologies/Concepts used in developing this project -:

1) HTML
2) CSS
3) FLEXBOX for layout purposes
4) Media Queries
5)Embeded Map with local device Navigation support (GPS)

Hope you guys like it.....
